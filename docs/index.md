# Abstract

Provide a brief overview of the project objectives, approach, and results.

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the process of automatically inferring a user’s activity (e.g., walking, sitting, standing) based on sensor data (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscope) typically from devices like smartphones and smartwatches. However traditional machine learning method’s performance decreases significantly in real-life applications due to the problem of data missingness. Data Missingness in sensors typically happens due to power limitation, hardware failure, transmission packet loss, and many more. Our goal through this project is two folds, first is to investigate the data missingness distribution for Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). The second is to build robust models that not only impute the IMU signals but also successfully perform the activity classification task.
